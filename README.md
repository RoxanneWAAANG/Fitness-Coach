# Personalized Fitness Coach

A Raspberry Pi-based system that tracks and evaluates exercise form using computer vision and motion sensors, providing real-time feedback through an LCD display and LED indicators.

## Project Overview

This system combines pose detection (using MoveNet) with motion tracking (MPU6050 sensor) to:
- Collect multi-modal exercise data (visual pose + motion)
- Train machine learning models for form quality assessment
- Provide real-time feedback during workouts
- Support multiple exercise types (squats, pushups, bicep curls)

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module
- MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope sensor (I2C address: `0x53`)
- I2C LCD display (I2C address: `0x27`)
- 3 LEDs for feedback:
  - Blue LED (GPIO 16): Good form
  - Green LED (GPIO 20): Moderate form
  - Yellow LED (GPIO 21): Poor form
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Software Dependencies

- Python==3.10
- tflite-runtime (for MoveNet model)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- PyTorch (for neural network models)
- scikit-learn (for RandomForest models)
- pandas, numpy (for data processing)
- RPLCD (for LCD control)
- Picamera2 (for camera access)
- RPi.GPIO (for LED control)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RoxanneWAAANG/Fitness-Coach.git
   cd Fitness-Coach
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the MoveNet TFLite model:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p models
   wget -O models/movenet.tflite https://tfhub.dev/google/lite-model/movenet/singlepose/lightning/tflite/float16/4?lite-format=tflite
   ```

## Data Collection

Use the `multi_collector.py` module to gather training data:

```bash
python run_multi_collector.py
```

This will:
- Prompt you to select an exercise type
- Collect user information (height, weight, experience level)
- Record sensor data and camera frames
- Save labeled data for model training

The data is organized into:
- `collected_data/pose_data/`: JSON files with pose keypoints
- `collected_data/mpu_data/`: CSV files with accelerometer/gyroscope data
- `collected_data/image_data/`: Captured images
- `collected_data/labeled_data/`: Processed data ready for training

## Model Training

Train form quality assessment models using:

```bash
python model_trainer.py --exercise squat --model random_forest
```

Options:
- `--exercise`: Exercise type (squat, pushup, bicep_curl)
- `--model`: Model type (random_forest, pytorch)
- `--list-exercises`: List available exercises in the collected data
- `--data-dir`: Directory for input data (default: collected_data)
- `--models-dir`: Directory for saving models (default: models)

Models will be saved to the `models/` directory.

## Running the Fitness Coach

Start the interactive fitness coach:

```bash
python fitness_coach_cli.py
```

This will:
1. Present a menu to select exercise mode or auto-detection
2. Monitor your movements in real-time
3. Provide feedback through:
   - LCD display showing exercise type and form quality
   - LED indicators (Blue = Good, Green = Moderate, Yellow = Poor)
   - Terminal output

Press Ctrl+C to return to the menu or exit the application.

## Project Structure

- `data_collector.py`: Core class for data collection using camera and MPU6050
- `run_data_collector.py`: Interactive script for collecting exercise data
- `model_trainer.py`: Trains and evaluates form quality models
- `fitness_coach_cli.py`: Main application with real-time feedback
- `models/`: Directory for storing trained models and the MoveNet model
- `collected_data/`: Directory for storing collected exercise data

## Troubleshooting

- **Hardware error**:
   - Test with `python utils/test_hardware.py`

- **Model training errors**:
  - Ensure sufficient data has been collected
  - Check log files in `training_logs/` directory
